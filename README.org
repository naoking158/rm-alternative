* rm-alternative

#+begin_src shell
$ rm --help
===============
This is a modified rm program to move SRC to RM_ALT_TRASH instead of remove it.
When this is executed from other script or program, then `/bin/rm` is executed.

Usage:
    rm [OPTION]... SRC [SRC]...

Options:
    -h, --help
    -n, --dry-run
    -d, --delete  ----  `rm -rf SRC` is executed using `/bin/rm` (Be careful!!!)
        --restore ----  Restore previously moved files to their original locations.
                            Previously moved history is saved in RM_ALT_HIST

Default values:
    RM_ALT_TRASH = ~/.myTrash
    RM_ALT_HIST  = $RM_ALT_TRASH/.moved_hist
#+end_src


** Features

- When =rm SRC= is executed, =SRC= is moved to =~/.myTrash=
  + If there is another =SRC= with the same name in =~/.myTrash/=, the older one will be renamed as SRC-DATE
- =rm [-d/--delete] SRC= invokes the system command: =/bin/rm -rf SRC=
- With =-n/---dry-run= option, no files will be moved, only what will be done will be displayed
- If you run =rm= by mistake, you can undo by running =rm -restore=

** Installation

1. Clone this repository

   #+begin_src shell

2. Set alias in =.bashrc=, =.zshrc=, etc...

   #+begin_src shell
   alias rm='/path/to/rm-alternative.bash'

3. *Option:* By setting =sudo= as an alias, commands registered in the alias can be invoked with =sudo=

   *Note that it is important to leave a space after sudo.*

   See ~man bash~ for more detail.
