#+begin_src bash
$ rm --help

This is a modified rm program to move SRC to ~/.myTrash instead of remove it.
When this is executed from other script or program, then `/bin/rm` is executed.

Usage:
    rm [OPTION]... SRC [SRC]...

Options:
    -h, --help
    -n, --dry-run
    -d, --delete  ----  `rm -rf SRC` is executed using `/bin/rm` (Be careful!!!)
        --restore ----  Restore previously moved files to their original locations.
                            Previously moved history is saved in `~/.myTrash/.moved.log`
#+end_src

* Features

- When =rm SRC= is executed, =SRC= is moved to =~/.myTrash=
  + If there is another =SRC= with the same name in =~/.myTrash/=, the older one will be renamed as SRC-DATE
- =rm [-d/--delete] SRC= invokes the system command: =/bin/rm -rf SRC=
- If you run it with the =-n/---dry-run= option, no files will be moved, only what will be done will be displayed
- If you replace the system default =/bin/rm= with =rm= in this repository, you can run it with =sudo=
- If you run =rm= by mistake, you can undo the previous file by running =rm -restore=
- (TODO) If =rm= command in this repository is executed from other script or program, =/bin/rm= is executed
