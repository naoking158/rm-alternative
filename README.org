* rm-alternative

#+begin_src bash
$ rm --help

This is a modified rm program to move SRC to ~/.myTrash instead of remove it.
When this is executed from other script or program, then `/bin/rm` is executed.

Usage:
    rm [OPTION]... SRC [SRC]...

Options:
    -h, --help
    -n, --dry-run
    -d, --delete  ----  `rm -rf SRC` is executed using `/bin/rm` (Be careful!!!)
        --restore ----  Restore previously moved files to their original locations.
                            Previously moved history is saved in `~/.myTrash/.moved.log`
